/*
Script Name: GoldBar.cs
Author: Shadow1980
Version: 1.0
Public Release: 05/07/05
Purpose:  A more effective way of storing huge amounts of gold.

Description: 		Gold bars are an effective way of storing large amounts of gold for players.
			Basically when attempting to create a bank check larger then 500,000 gp, a
			gold bar will be created for every 500,000 gp. Gold bars when double clicked
			in a players bank box will change into a 500,000 gp check again. The advantage
			of gold bars to players is that gold bars are stackable, where checks are not.
			(Because checks have variable values you can't really make them stackable)
			Rather then increasing the size checks can be, this system provides a more 
			realistic storage method.

Acknowledgements: 	Thanks to Admin Vorspire for releasing an entirely different gold bar system that 
			brought this idea into my head.
