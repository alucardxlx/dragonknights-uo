{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.15.1507;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs20 Ok well this is my first quest so I may miss some things. Hopefully not though lol. Heres the run down. First Quest guy Vladamir spawn whereever you'd like. Second Quest char Verona she should be placed somewhere in Vesper. Third Quest char Simeon should be in Cove.  And then Meiko should spawn in Rock dungeon in Ish.  Now with them in place spawn Mythos in the Iced Area in Malas, fell free to spawn vampires and the walking dead and MinionLords near him as well as the others ones too. North of Brit cemetary there are openings in the mountians spawn Celeste in one of them.  Acheron is spawned in the north-eastern most part of hyloth level 2. Zodiac is spawned in Blood dungeon wherever you have room best place though would be in the center.  Ulic is spawned in Exodous dungeon.  Now last but not least Serraphim in Ankh dungeon.  Remember to spawn vampires and the wlaking dead as well as minionlords around then well near them I should say. GillesDeRay should be spawned somewhere in Rock dungeon not to far from where Meiko is.\par
As For Dracula to the south of Luna there is a Cave guarded by a fellow theres a field up in front of it set Draculasteleporter there and set the Coords to somewhere inside the cavern. \par

NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT: Test out each monster first adjust the VA/Virtual Armor and Hits/HitPoints to get the difficulty set for your players so it's neither to hard or to easy.\par
Dracula is set to only take magic damage till half life then you have to do physical damage to finsih him off.  The FISTSOFPAIN must be eqquiped prior to putting on normal gloves let your players know this. Also let the players know it's IMPORTANT to read the gumps most players pay no attention to them this quest is set up to where you can only go through in order so they need to pay some attention otherwise you and your GM's might suffer the wrath of 50 people angry cause they have no idea what to do.  There is no skipping around! it just wont work. I've made it this way to give the quest more value as well as the items.  Feel free to adjust the mods on the items to fit your shards needs. \par
\par
Something Nifty I threw in... when double clicking any peice of the vampiregear it'll morph into a different style of armor this will allow the players to achieve uniqueness which alot enjoy. With all that said enjoy an I hope your players like it. Oh by the way let me know what you as well as your players think of this quest if liked enough there will be a sequal to it where all the Quest chars take the items you've given them to combine a Abyss Cocktail to gain supreme power. lol. Anyway thanks and havefun!\par
